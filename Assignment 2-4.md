## Assignemnt M1-1

#### Questions 2 - 4.

__2. "In our “Say Hi” example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, 
how would you narrow down the problem?"__

__2A.__
	1. Check to make sure the Say Hi code is correct. It may have an error
that needs to be corrected.
	2. If the code is correct, I'd go backwards to the submit button to 
ensure that it's calling the Say Hi code. 
	3. If the code is correct, I'd look at any validation I might have for
the input field. For example, the button might not submit if there's no text or
not enough text in the input field.
	4. If all validations are correct, I'd make sure the input field is
correct in that it accepts input from the user.
	5. If that's ok, I'd start looking at my environment:
		1. Security permissions are good
		2. The executable ended up in the right place (production, staging...)
		3. The server is running
	6. If all is good, I'd start reseraching in Google and Stack Overflow.
	7. If still stuck, ask a person (e.g. my mentor, slack, another developer)
	8. If still not working, re-write from scratch.
	9. Still a problem? Team code from scratch.


__3. "What would the roadmap for narrowing down the Say Hi problem look like?"__

__3A.__
	1. Ensure correctness of Say Hi function
	2. Ensure correctness of submit button
	3. Ensure correctness of data validations
	4. Ensure input field is accepting input
	5. Ensure environment is correct
	6. Research on Google and Stack Overflow
	7. Ask a person: mentor, slack, another developer
	8. Rewrite from scratch
	9. Team code from scratch

__4. "Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process 
of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use 
this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in your 
everyday life."__

__4A. "Where are my keys?"__

	1. Look in the two places I've designated as the right places to
put my keys (key drawer, bedside table).
	2. Get annoyed that I didn't follow my own rules.
	3. Make a mental list of other places I've put my keys in the past.
		1. Pants
		2. Did it end up in the washer or dryer
		3. Still in the car
		4. In the glove box
		5. In my wife's purse
		6. Ask around the house.
	4. Make a list of where I've been since I last saw my keys.
	5. Make calls and visit these places.
	6. Use my wife's copy!
